## Background

### Project Runtime Environment

1. This project only works at 1920*1080 resolution.
2. This project only works in Bluestack.
3. This project requires installing tesseractocr on the computer and adding it to environment variables.
4. Tesseract only runs normally on Windows, so this project can only be tested on Windows.

### About Ban Mechanisms

(After understanding COC's ban mechanism, it can be applied to other games in the future.)
1. Repeatedly clicking the same coordinates.
	1. Whether deploying troops or various clicks, they must be randomly clicked within the maximum possible range.
2. Total time control.
	1. Online time should not exceed 10 hours per day.
3. Adding rest time.
	1. For example, after 10 to 20 attacks, automatically idle for 10 to 20 minutes.
4. Possible detection of multiple accounts on the same device with the same IP address.
	1. One device with one IP should ideally have only 10 accounts.
	2. If there are more accounts, change VPN address. Express VPN can provide fixed addresses, 10 accounts per address.
	3. Different devices can use virtual machines, whether Android virtual machines or Windows virtual machines can be created. This will be studied later. One IP address with one device should be sufficient.
	4. Script variations: write multiple scripts, for example, one script deploys Lightning Dragons, another deploys Fire Dragons, 5 accounts use Lightning Dragons, 5 accounts use Fire Dragons.
5. Too many clicks in one battle with too short intervals will result in bans.
	1. Can use drag and hold combined with random clicking, with random click count upper limit, such as 30 times.
